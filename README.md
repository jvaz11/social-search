# Advanced Social Search for Developers 

A tool to search for recent posts from Twitter and Instagram that match a hashtag. Each post returned by the search query is displayed along with useful meta-data, like the date/time the post was created, the user name of the poster, and the direct URL to the post.

##Note :

This is a work in progress. I'm building this as a way of applying a combination of web development technologies I've learned over the past couple of years.
